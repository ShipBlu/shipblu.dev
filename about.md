	<p class="intro"><a href="https://shipblu.com" target="_blank">ShipBlu</a> designs hyper-optimized processes for running a last-mile delivery network in low-resource settings, tailored for eCommerce sellers. Our Engineering team turns these processes into usable software for both our clients and internal team members.</p>
	<h2>What Optimizations?</h2>
	<p>The goal of our operations network is to get a parcel from point A to point B in the most efficient way. Efficiency means less time and less operational cost. Towards that goal, we tackle unique challanges such as the poor addressing systems in suburbs, cash lifecycle for eCommerce merchants and unverified online sales that lead to failed deliveries. </p>
	<h2>Our Technology</h2>
	<p>We design our unique operational processes and build our technology in-house. Our technology evolves as the size and impact of our business grow. This blog is to share what we learn along the way, whether it's a technical challenge, a new software platform, or code optimization tips.</p>
	<p>If you are into tech-enabled businesses, we would love to get to know you. Send us a <i>Hello</i> to <a href="mailto:tech@shipblu.com">tech@shipblu.com</a>. We would be super happy to talk with you about what we do.</p>
